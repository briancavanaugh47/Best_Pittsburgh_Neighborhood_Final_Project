The median age at death is calculated for each municipality in Allegheny County. Data is based on the decedent's residence at the time of death, not the location where the death occurred.

## Data Set 2 Analyzed by Samuel Settie: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-fast-food/resource/3c530161-2976-41ae-a0f0-7d3e74835049
The Allegheny County Health Department has generated this list of fast food restaurants by exporting all chain restaurants without an alcohol permit from the Countyâ€™s Fee and Permit System. A chain restaurant defined by the County is any restaurant that has more than one location in the County. Chain restaurants capture both local and national chains (including locally owned national chains) so long as there is one or more establishments in operation within the County.

## Data Set 3 Analyzed by Anthony Arshoun: https://data.wprdc.org/dataset/allegheny-county-air-quality/resource/36fb4629-8003-4acc-a1ca-3302778a530d?filters=is_valid%3Atrue%7Cunit%3APPM
Allegheny County has measured Air Quality in several different neighborhoods using a few pollutants as metrics. Data is captured as measurements of H2S, SO2, H2S_SO2, NO, NO2, and Ozone from various devices.
